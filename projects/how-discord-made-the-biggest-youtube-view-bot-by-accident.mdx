## What is a view bot?

A view bot is a program that artificially increases the number of views of a video on a platform such as YouTube. This can be done by using multiple proxies to simulate multiple users watching the video at the same time. View bots are often used to make a video appear more popular than it actually is, which can help increase its visibility and attract more organic views. However, using a view bot violates the terms of service of most platforms and can result in the video being removed or the account being banned.

## How did Discord create a working YouTube view bot?

As an April Fool's joke in 2024, Discord released a loot box feature. They announced this with a little toast at the bottom of the page, along with a video that played during the announcement. The video looped until you interacted with it. This was the first time Discord had used video in an announcement. The video was hosted on YouTube and embedded into the announcement. This caused Discord's video views to skyrocket. Discord accidentally created a working YouTube view bot.

## How did Discord break several world records?

The GTA 6 trailer has long held the Guinness World Record for a long time.
It also set a new milestone for any game-reveal video on YouTube. However, the new hilarious Discord April Fool's Day video has smashed that record, racking up a staggering 1.4 billion views in just 24 hours.

The previous record for the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours was held by the song Butter by BTS with **108 million** views and the non-music video record was held by Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1 with over 90 million views in 24 hours. Discord has broken this record with 1.4 billion views in 24 hours. This is a new world record for the most viewed video in both the music and non-music categories on YouTube in 24 hours.
